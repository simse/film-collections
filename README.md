## Questions and Answers
**Is X collection up to date?**

You can check! All collections are run twice a day on Github Actions. So you can check [here](https://github.com/simse/film-collections/actions/workflows/run-everything.yaml), if an update has been successfully run.

**Can you add X collection?**

I can, if you can find a good scrapable source (e.g. Wikipedia). Open an issue with your request and a link to a source.

**Can I use this for X?**

Of course.
